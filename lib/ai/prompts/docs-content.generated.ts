The `@tscircuit/math-utils` package is\ngenerally available in any platform that uses `tscircuit`.\n\nThe source code for the `@tscircuit/math-utils` package [is available here](https://github.com/tscircuit/math-utils)\n\n\n## `grid`\n\nA utility function that generates a grid of cells with configurable dimensions, spacing, and positioning. Each cell contains its index, position (row/column), and coordinate points (center, top-left, bottom-right).\n\n```tsx\nimport { grid } from \"@tscircuit/math-utils\"\n\nconst gridCells = grid({\n  rows: 3,\n  cols: 3,\n  width: 300,   // optional\n  height: 300,  // optional\n  xSpacing: 100,  // optional, default: 1\n  ySpacing: 100,  // optional, default: 1\n  offsetX: 0,     // optional, default: 0\n  offsetY: 0,     // optional, default: 0\n  yDirection: \"cartesian\", // optional, default: \"cartesian\"\n  centered: true  // optional, default: true\n})\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"30mm\" height=\"30mm\">\n    {gridCells.map((cell) => (\n      <led\n        name={`LED${cell.index}`}\n        footprint=\"led_0402\"\n        schX={cell.center.x}\n        schY={cell.center.y}\n        pcbX={cell.center.x}\n        pcbY={cell.center.y}\n      />\n    ))}\n  </board>\n)\n```\n\nThe array of `GridCellPositions` contains:\n- `index`: Sequential cell number\n- `row`, `col`: Grid position\n- `center`, `topLeft`, `bottomRight`: Coordinate points\n\n================\nFile: docs/advanced/units.md\n================\n---\ntitle: tscircuit Units\n---\n\nIn tscircuit you can specify a unit explicitly with a string e.g. \"0.1mm\", but\nyou can also also specify numbers without units and the unit will be inferred\nfrom [platform](../guides/platform-configuration.md), [board configuration](../elements/board.mdx), [subcircuit configuration](../elements/subcircuit.mdx)\nor the defaults below\n\n## Default Units\n\nBy default, tscircuit uses the following base units:\n\n| Measurement Type | Base Unit | Description  |\n| ---------------- | --------- | ------------ |\n| Length           | mm        | Millimeters  |\n| Time             | ms        | Milliseconds |\n| Mass             | g         | Grams        |\n| Angle            | deg       | Degrees      |\n| Frequency        | Hz        | Hertz        |\n| Volume           | ml        | Milliliters  |\n| Voltage          | V         | Volts        |\n| Current          | A         | Amperes      |\n| Resistance       | Ω         | Ohms         |\n| Capacitance      | F         | Farads       |\n| Inductance       | H         | Henries      |\n\nBase units are chosen based on the industry convention.\n\n================\nFile: docs/building-electronics/designing-electronics-from-scratch.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Designing Electronics from Scratch\nsidebar_position: 2\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nTypically electronics engineers go through the following steps when designing\na new electronic device.\n\n1. Requirements Analysis\n2. System Diagramming\n3. Schematic Capture\n4. PCB Layout\n5. Ordering\n\n## Requirements Analysis\n\nThis stage is all about making sure you have a clear idea of what the device\nshould do. Your development and cost preferences are a huge factor here.\n\n1. What should the device do?\n2. How much power is needed?\n3. How much processing power do I need?\n4. Do I want to run linux, MicroPython, or low-level C code? Do I even need\n   to run code?\n5. How much does cost matter?\n6. Should I use only parts available from turn-key manufacturers like JLCPCB?\n\n## System Diagramming\n\nIn this phase we create a diagram overview of the system and how things connect\ntogether abstractly\n\n1. What components should I use?\n2. How do things connect together at a high level?\n\nThe system diagram can instantly communicate how your design works to others.\n\n### System Diagram Example 1: Bluetooth Humidity and CO2 Sensor\n\nHere's an example of a system diagram for a simple IoT device that takes\nhumidity and CO2 measurements and can communicate them via bluetooth.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/system-diagram-1.png\" alt=\"System Diagram Example 1\" />\n<figcaption>System Diagram Example 1</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Schematic Capture\n\nIn this phase we create a schematic diagram of the system and how things connect\ntogether.\n\n1. Using reference designs, datasheets or pre-made modules, create all the\n   elements of the circuit in tscircuit\n2. Run design checks to make sure the circuit is hooked up correctly\n\nIn this phase you should create chip modules or [import third party chips](../guides/importing-modules-and-chips/importing-from-jlcpcb.mdx)\nas you build up your circuit. You shouldn't be configuring chips in\nthe same file that connects all your chips together- give each chip it's own\nmodule.\n\nAfter the schematics look good, you can export to a readable netlist and upload\nthe netlist to AI tools like OpenAI O1 to get a review and make sure everything\nis connected properly! This is also a good stage to get your schematic reviewed\nby your team members.\n\n## PCB Layout\n\nIn this phase we create a layout of the circuit on a PCB.\n\ntscircuit automatically autoroutes the circuit for you, but you may still need\nto \"drag'n'drop\" components in the PCB viewer to the locations you want them to\nbe in. Use [manual editing](../guides/manual-edits.mdx) to drag'n'drop\ncomponents on the PCB.\n\n## Ordering\n\nIn this phase we order the PCB from a manufacturer. Typically this is done\nby downloading [Fabrication Files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)\nand \"dragging and dropping\" them into a manufacturer's website.\n\nSometimes you'll want to assemble the PCB yourself (or sometimes just a single\ncomponent that your manufacturer doesn't have!). In this case, you'll need a\nlab setup to facilitate soldering.\n\nCheck out our guide on [Ordering Prototypes](./ordering-prototypes.mdx) to learn more.\n\n================\nFile: docs/building-electronics/ordering-prototypes.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: Ordering Prototypes\nsidebar_position: 4\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nAfter [you've designed your device](./designing-electronics-from-scratch.md),\nyou can use [fabrication files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)\nto get your device fully assembled.\n\nThe two most popular services for\nordering prototypes are [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and [PCBWay](https://pcbway.com).\n\n## Uploading [Fabrication Files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md)\n\nMost fabrication or turn-key assembly services allow you to directly upload 3 types of files:\n\n- Gerbers\n- Bill of Materials (BOM CSV)\n- Pick'n'Place File (CSV)\n\nThese files are all available inside your [Fabrication Files zip file](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md) when\nyou export from tscircuit.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/jlcpcb-upload.png\" />\n<figcaption>Many fabricators allow you to directly drop fabrication files on their website!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Assembling your own boards\n\nIt can sometimes be easier to assemble your own boards, this gives you more\ncontrol over your inventory and can lower the cost of your prototypes since\nassembly services often have a minimum order quantity.\n\nEven if you're assembling your own board, you should still order your PCB\nfrom a fabrication service. PCBs require a chemical etching process to do\nat home and it's rarely worth the hassle to do it yourself.\n\nWhen you're assembling your own board, you can create a printout of your\nAssembly View to make it easier to place components. In an assembly view,\nthe \"pin1\" location is marked with a cut corner. This can help you verify\nthe orientation of each component as you place it.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/assembly-view-in-editor.png\" />\n</figure>\n\n================\nFile: docs/building-electronics/what-are-electronics-made-of.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: What are electronics made of?\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\"\n\n## Overview\n\nIn this tutorial, we're going to be talking about the different elements that\nmake up a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). For each element, we'll show different\nways that the element can be represented in tscircuit.\n\n## What is copper? Why are PCBs green?\n\nCopper is a conductive material that's used on a PCB to make an electrical\nconnection between chips. A PCB is mostly made up of fiberglass with a small\nlayer of precisely etched copper. The fiberglass is non-conductive and often\ncoated with non-conductive green \"soldermask\" to cover parts of the copper that\naren't meant to be connected to chips.\n\n<figure style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n<img style={{ width: 400, height: 240, objectFit: \"cover\" }} src=\"/img/ai-pcb-1.webp\" alt=\"AI Generated PCB Image\" />\n<figcaption>An AI-generated PCB image. All the yellow parts represent copper, while the green parts represent fiberglass with a green soldermask</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nA PCB can be thought of as a bunch of \"printed\" copper separated by fiberglass\nsections that \"insulate\" or don't conduct electricity. We \"glue\" (solder) chips\nto the copper \"pads\" to add them to the circuit.\n\n## What are PCB layers?\n\nWhen you print on a piece of paper, you can print \"single-sided\" or \"double-sided\",\nPCBs can also be printed singled-sided or double-sided! The \"front\" of the PCB\nis called the \"top\" layer, and the \"back\" of the PCB is called the \"bottom\" layer.\n\nWe can \"print\" copper to each of these layers to draw lots of wires and connect\nlots of chips. Sometimes a wire needs to \"go over\"/\"go under\" another wire\nbecause the wires aren't allowed to cross. When this happens, we can use the\n\"back\" or \"bottom layer\" of the PCB to draw the wire so that the wires don't\naccidentally touch.\n\n## Vias\n\nVias are holes that connect different layers of PCB. Let's say you have a chip\non the top layer of a PCB and the back layer of a PCB. How can you connect them?\nThe copper on the top needs some way to \"pass through\" to the bottom layer.\n\nThis is where vias come in. A via is a hole that is \"filled with copper\" so that\nthe top layer can pass to the bottom.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/via.png\" alt=\"Vias\" /> \n<figcaption>Vias connect different layers of a PCB</figcaption> \n</figure>\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\n\nexport default () => (\n  <footprint>\n    <via\n      toLayer=\"bottom\"\n      fromLayer=\"top\"\n      holeDiameter=\"0.25mm\"\n      outerDiameter=\"0.6mm\"\n    />\n  </footprint>\n)\n\n`} />\n\n\n## Plated Holes\n\nA plated hole is similar to a via but it's hollow so that you can push metal pins\nthrough it. This is important for chips that have big pins that need to fit into\nholes. Chips with big pins that must go through holes are called \"through-hole\"\nchips, and chips with small\npins are called \"surface-mount\" chips.\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <footprint>\n    <platedhole\n      shape=\"circle\"\n      x=\"5mm\"\n      y=\"2.4mm\"\n      holeDiameter=\"0.25mm\"\n      outerDiameter=\"0.35mm\"\n    />\n  </footprint>\n)\n\n`} />\n\n## Unplated Holes \"Regular Holes\"\n\nUnplated holes or \"regular holes\" are just holes in the printed circuit board\nwithout any copper around them. They don't electrically connect anything, but\ncan be very helpful for mounting the printed circuit board.\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <footprint>\n    <hole diameter=\"1mm\" />\n  </footprint>\n)\n\n`} />\n\n## Traces\n\nTraces are the wires that connect the components on a PCB. They are made of\ncopper and mostly covered by green soldermask so that they don't accidentally\nconduct to each other if something conductive like a wire or piece of metal falls\nacross them.\n\nWe represent traces in PCB viewers with different colors depending on what\nlayer they fall on. In tscircuit, traces are always autorouted, so you don't\nneed to tell it which path to take- it'll automatically find one that makes sure\nit doesn't cross any other traces.\n\nTraces allow chips to \"talk\" to each other and for power to be shared across all\nchips.\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <resistor\n      resistance=\"1k\"\n      footprint=\"0402\"\n      name=\"R1\"\n      schX={3}\n      pcbX={3}\n    />\n    <capacitor\n      capacitance=\"1000pF\"\n      footprint=\"0402\"\n      name=\"C1\"\n      schX={-3}\n      pcbX={-3}\n    />\n    <trace from=\".R1 > .pin1\" to=\".C1 > .pin1\" />\n  </board>\n)\n\n`} />\n\n## What are inner layers?\n\nInner layers are layers of PCB that aren't visible, they're sandwiched on the\ninside. Sometimes this is useful when you have a lot of wires to connect and\nit's almost impossible to stop them from crossing each other.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/pcb-layers.png\" alt=\"Inner layers\" /> \n<figcaption>Inner layers are layers of PCB that aren't visible, they're sandwiched on the inside.

It contains all the logic for converting React components into circuit boards, schematics and PCBs.\n\nThe core library is written in Typescript and uses React. It's a great project to contribute to if you want to learn about how tscircuit works under the hood.\n\nHere's a [video tutorial for contributing to core](https://blog.tscircuit.com/p/learn-how-to-contribute-to-tscircuits-core).\n\n================\nFile: docs/contributing/overview-of-projects.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Overview of Projects\nsidebar_position: 2\n---\n\n| Repo                                                                          | Description                                                                                    | Open Issues                                                                                                                                 |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [tscircuit/core](https://github.com/tscircuit/core)                           | Core library that powers tscircuit, handles conversion of React components into circuit boards | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/core)](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/issues)                           |\n| [tscircuit/schematic-symbols](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols) | Library of schematic symbols used across tscircuit                                             | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/schematic-symbols)](https://github.com/tscircuit/schematic-symbols/issues) |\n| [tscircuit/footprinter](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter)             | Generates PCB footprints from string descriptions                                              | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/footprinter)](https://github.com/tscircuit/footprinter/issues)             |\n| [tscircuit/circuit-to-svg](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg)       | Converts Circuit JSON into SVG files                                                           | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg)](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg/issues)       |\n| [tscircuit/tscircuit.com](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com)         | Main website and circuit board editor                                                          | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/tscircuit.com)](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit.com/issues)         |\n| [tscircuit/cli](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli)                             | Main development tool for tscircuit, provides local development server and package management  | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/cli)](https://github.com/tscircuit/cli/issues)                             |\n| [tscircuit/runframe](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe)                   | React component to preview and run tscircuit circuits                                          | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/runframe)](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/issues)                   |\n| [tscircuit/pcb-viewer](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer)               | React component for viewing PCBs                                                               | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/pcb-viewer)](https://github.com/tscircuit/pcb-viewer/issues)               |\n| [tscircuit/3d-viewer](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer)                 | React component for viewing 3D previews                                                        | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/3d-viewer)](https://github.com/tscircuit/3d-viewer/issues)                 |\n| [tscircuit/easyeda-converter](https://github.com/tscircuit/easyeda-converter) | Command line utility for converting JLCPCB footprints to tscircuit                             | [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tscircuit/easyeda-converter)](https://github.com/tscircuit/easyeda-converter/issues) |\n\n================\nFile: docs/contributing/the-contributor-handbook.md\n================\n---\ntitle: The Contributor Handbook\n---\n\nWe have some important patterns that make contributing to\ntscircuit more consistent, we document these in [our handbook repo](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook).\n\nHere are a couple of really important ones:\n\n1. [Use Yalc](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook/blob/main/guides/using-yalc.md) - tscircuit uses many repositories so it can be hard to test different repositories interacting.\n2. [Code Styles](https://github.com/tscircuit/handbook/blob/main/guides/code.md) - tscircuit has some consistent code patterns we use in every project. This makes the code more universally understood.

Everything\ngoes in a board!\n\n\nimport CircuitPreview from '@site/src/components/CircuitPreview'\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\n  export default () => (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <resistor resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" name=\"R1\" />\n    </board>\n  )\n\n`} />\n\n\n## Board Properties\n\n### Customizing the Size of the Board\n\nGenerally you'll use the `width` and `height` properties to define the size of\nthe board.\n\n### Setting the `autorouter`\n\nBoards or [subcircuits](./subcircuit.mdx) can specify what autorouter should be\nused to route any traces within them.\n\nUsually you'll want to use an autorouter preset:\n\n- `autorouter=\"auto\"` - Uses the [platform configuration](../guides/platform-configuration.md). For tscircuit.com this defaults to `sequential-trace`.\n- `autorouter=\"sequential-trace\"` - Iterate over each trace and use tscircuit's fast built-in autorouter. This method is fast and deterministic but often fails with over 50 traces.\n- `autorouter=\"auto-local\"` - Use the platform configuration, but only route locally (do not make API calls)\n- `autorouter=\"auto-cloud\"` - Use the platform configuration for \n\nFor complex boards with over 50 traces, you should use `autorouter=\"auto-cloud\"`\nto take advantage of tscircuit's cloud autorouters, which internally use the popular\n[freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) library.\n\nYou can also specify a custom autorouter object to use your own autorouter.\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board\n      width=\"20mm\"\n      height=\"20mm\"\n      autorouter={{\n        serverUrl: \"https://registry-api.tscircuit.com\",\n        serverMode: \"job\",\n        inputFormat: \"simplified\",\n      }}\n    >\n      <chip name=\"U1\" footprint=\"soic8\" pcbX={5} pcbY={0} />\n      <resistor\n        name=\"R1\"\n        pcbX={-5}\n        pcbY={0}\n        resistance={100}\n        footprint=\"0402\"\n      />\n      <trace from=\".U1 > .pin1\" to=\".R1 > .pin1\" />\n    </board>\n  )\n`} />\n\nLearn more about [the Autorouting API here](../web-apis/autorouting-api.mdx)\n\n\n### Custom Board Outlines\n\nYou can specify a custom outline for your board by passing an `outline` prop.\nThe PCB you get will have this outline cut out, this is great when you want a\nboard that's not a rectangle!\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board\n    outline={[\n      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },\n      { x: 22.5, y: 24.5 },\n      { x: 22.5, y: 16.5 },\n      { x: 20.5, y: 16.5 },\n      { x: 20.5, y: 12.5 },\n      { x: 22.5, y: 12.5 },\n      { x: 22.5, y: 2.5 },\n      { x: 18, y: -1.5 },\n      { x: 18, y: -18 },\n      { x: -18, y: -18 },\n      { x: -18, y: -1.5 },\n      { x: -22.5, y: 2.5 },\n      { x: -22.5, y: 12.5 },\n      { x: -20.5, y: 12.5 },\n      { x: -20.5, y: 16.5 },\n      { x: -22.5, y: 16.5 },\n      { x: -22.5, y: 24.5 },\n    ]}\n\n    // These are currently required due to this issue:\n    // https://github.com/tscircuit/core/issues/564\n    width=\"50mm\"\n    height=\"50mm\"\n  />\n)\n\n`} />\n\n## Flexible PCBs\n\n:::info\nInterested in flexible PCBs?

Capacitors are commonly used for filtering, energy storage, and timing circuits. Unlike resistors, capacitors can be polarized (like electrolytic capacitors) or non-polarized (like ceramic capacitors).\n\nA capacitor element has two pins. Polarized capacitors must be placed with correct orientation to avoid damage.\n\nWhen specifying a capacitor, you'll need to provide a footprint string (like `0402` or `0805`) and capacitance value. Popular capacitor types and sizes can be found at [jlcsearch](https://jlcsearch.tscircuit.com/capacitors/list).\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\"\n\n<CircuitPreview\n  defaultView=\"schematic\"\n  code={`\n\n  export default () => (\n    <capacitor\n      name=\"C2\"\n      footprint=\"axial_p5mm\"\n      capacitance=\"10μF\"\n      polarized\n    />\n  )\n\n  `}\n/>\n\n## Pins\n\nA capacitor has the following pins and aliases:\n\n| Pin # | Aliases (Polarized) | Description |\n| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| pin1 | pos, anode, left | The positive terminal (required for polarized capacitors) |\n| pin2 | neg, cathode, right | The negative terminal (must be connected properly for polarized caps) |\n\n:::warning\nFor polarized capacitors, you must connect the positive and negative pins correctly. Reversing polarity can cause capacitor failure or even explosion!\n:::\n\n## Specifications\n\nCapacitors can be configured with these key properties:\n\n- **capacitance** - The capacitance value specified as a string e.g. `\"100nF\"` or `\"2.2μF\"`\n- **voltageRating** - Maximum voltage the capacitor can handle e.g. `\"25V\"`\n- **tolerance** - Capacitance tolerance percentage e.g. `\"±10%\"`\n- **temperatureCoefficient** - Temperature stability specification e.g. `\"X7R\"`\n- **equivalentSeriesResistance** - ESR value for critical applications e.g. `\"0.5Ω\"`\n\n## Automatic Part Selection\n\nLike resistors, tscircuit will automatically select suitable capacitor parts based on your specifications through the [platform parts engine](../guides/platform-configuration.md). For specialized capacitors (e.g., low ESR, high voltage), you may want to specify `supplierPartNumbers` explicitly.\n\n================\nFile: docs/elements/chip.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: <chip />\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\"\n\nThe `<chip />` is the most common and most powerful built-in tscircuit element.\nYou can represent virtually any \"single-part\" electronic component with `<chip />`,\nit is extremely flexible.\n\n## Simple Chips\n\nHere's an example of typical `<chip />` usage.

You can use this to group similar pins together e.g. to\ngroup GPIO pins together.\n\n:::note\n`schPortArrangement` was renamed to `schPinArrangement` in 2025.\n:::\n\n<CircuitPreview splitView defaultView=\"schematic\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <chip\n      name=\"U1\"\n      footprint=\"soic8\"\n      schPortArrangement={{\n        leftSide: {\n          direction: \"top-to-bottom\",\n          pins: [\"VCC\", \"DISCH\", \"THRES\", \"CTRL\"],\n        },\n        rightSide: {\n          direction: \"bottom-to-top\",\n          pins: [\"GND\", \"TRIG\", \"OUT\", \"RESET\"],\n        },\n      }}\n      pinLabels={{\n        pin1: \"VCC\",\n        pin2: \"DISCH\",\n        pin3: \"THRES\",\n        pin4: \"CTRL\",\n        pin5: \"GND\",\n        pin6: \"TRIG\",\n        pin7: \"OUT\",\n        pin8: \"RESET\"\n      }}\n    />\n  </board>\n)\n`}\n/>\n\nYou can also place pins on the top or bottom of the schematic box.\n\n<CircuitPreview splitView defaultView=\"schematic\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <chip\n      name=\"U1\"\n      footprint=\"soic8\"\n      schPortArrangement={{\n        topSide: {\n          direction: \"left-to-right\",\n          pins: [\"VCC\"],\n        },\n        bottomSide: {\n          direction: \"left-to-right\",\n          pins: [\"GND\"],\n        },\n        leftSide: {\n          direction: \"top-to-bottom\",\n          pins: [\"DISCH\", \"THRES\", \"CTRL\"],\n        },\n        rightSide: {\n          direction: \"bottom-to-top\",\n          pins: [\"TRIG\", \"OUT\", \"RESET\"],\n        },\n      }}\n      pinLabels={{\n        pin1: \"VCC\",\n        pin2: \"DISCH\",\n        pin3: \"THRES\",\n        pin4: \"CTRL\",\n        pin5: \"GND\",\n        pin6: \"TRIG\",\n        pin7: \"OUT\",\n        pin8: \"RESET\"\n      }}\n    />\n  </board>\n)\n`} />\n\n### `schPinStyles`\n\n`schPinStyles` controls the style of the pins on the schematic box \n\n<CircuitPreview splitView defaultView=\"schematic\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <chip\n        name=\"U1\"\n        footprint=\"soic8\"\n        schPinArrangement={{\n          topSide: {\n            direction: \"left-to-right\",\n            pins: [\"VCC\"],\n          },\n          bottomSide: {\n            direction: \"left-to-right\",\n            pins: [\"GND\"],\n          },\n          leftSide: {\n            direction: \"top-to-bottom\",\n            pins: [\"DISCH\", \"THRES\", \"CTRL\"],\n          },\n          rightSide: {\n            direction: \"bottom-to-top\",\n            pins: [\"TRIG\", \"OUT\", \"RESET\"],\n          },\n        }}\n        schPinStyle={{\n          pin1: {\n            bottomMargin: 0.2\n          },\n          GND: {\n            rightMargin: \"0.5mm\"\n          },\n          THRES: {\n            topMargin: 0.5\n          },\n          OUT: {\n            topMargin: 1,\n            bottomMargin: \"1mm\"\n          }\n        }}\n        // This is the future syntax for schPinStyle!\n        //   schPinStyle={{\n          //   pin1: {\n            //   marginBottom: 0.2,\n          //   },\n          //   GND: { marginRight: \"0.5mm\" },\n          //   THRES: { marginTop: 0.5 },\n          //   OUT: {\n            //   marginTop: 1,\n            //   marginBottom: \"1mm\",\n          //   },\n        //   }}\n        pinLabels={{\n          pin1: \"VCC\",\n          pin2: \"DISCH\",\n          pin3: \"THRES\",\n          pin4: \"CTRL\",\n          pin5: \"GND\",\n          pin6: \"TRIG\",\n          pin7: \"OUT\",\n          pin8: \"RESET\",\n        }}\n      />\n    </board>\n)\n`} />\n\n\n### Custom Footprints\n\nOften you will have a chip that you want to carefully specify the position of\neach pad, plated hole, silkscreen line or other PCB element. To do this, just\ninsert a `<footprint />` component instead of string for the `footprint` prop.\n\nHere's an example of a chip with a custom footprint:\n\n<CircuitPreview splitView defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <chip\n      name=\"U1\"\n      footprint={\n        <footprint>\n          <platedhole\n            portHints={[\"4\"]}\n            pcbX=\"3.2499299999998357mm\"\n            pcbY=\"-2.249932000000058mm\"\n            outerDiameter=\"1.9999959999999999mm\"\n            holeDiameter=\"1.3000228mm\"\n            shape=\"circle\"\n          />\n          <platedhole\n            portHints={[\"2\"]}\n            pcbX=\"3.2499299999998357mm\"\n            pcbY=\"2.249932000000058mm\"\n            outerDiameter=\"1.9999959999999999mm\"\n            holeDiameter=\"1.3000228mm\"\n            shape=\"circle\"\n          />\n          <platedhole\n            portHints={[\"1\"]}\n            pcbX=\"-3.2499299999999494mm\"\n            pcbY=\"2.249932000000058mm\"\n            outerDiameter=\"1.9999959999999999mm\"\n            holeDiameter=\"1.3000228mm\"\n            shape=\"circle\"\n          />\n          <platedhole\n            portHints={[\"3\"]}\n            pcbX=\"-3.2499299999999494mm\"\n            pcbY=\"-2.249932000000058mm\"\n            outerDiameter=\"1.9999959999999999mm\"\n            holeDiameter=\"1.3000228mm\"\n            shape=\"circle\"\n          />\n          <silkscreenpath\n            route={[\n              { x: -2.2743160000001126, y: -2.999994000000015 },\n              { x: 2.274315999999999, y: -2.999994000000015 },\n            ]}\n          />\n          <silkscreenpath\n            route={[\n              { x: -2.999994000000129, y: 1.0999978000000965 },\n              { x: -2.999994000000129, y: -0.999998000000005 },\n            ]}\n          />\n          <silkscreenpath\n            route={[\n              { x: 3.0999937999998792, y: 1.0279888000000028 },\n              { x: 3.0999937999998792, y: -1.0999977999999828 },\n            ]}\n          />\n          <silkscreenpath\n            route={[\n              { x: -1.99999600000001, y: 2.999994000000015 },\n              { x: 2.274315999999999, y: 2.999994000000015 },\n            ]}\n          />\n        </footprint>\n      }\n      schPortArrangement={{\n        leftSide: {\n          direction: \"top-to-bottom\",\n          pins: [1, 3],\n        },\n        rightSide: {\n          direction: \"bottom-to-top\",\n          pins: [4, 2],\n        },\n      }}\n    />\n  </board>\n)\n`} />\n\nFor more information about custom footprints, check out the [<footprint /> element](./footprint.mdx)\n\n### Internally Connected Pins\n\nSome chips, such as a standard 4 pin pushbutton, have pins that are internally\nconnected. This can be useful to represent for simulation or to enable omitting\npins from a schematic.\n\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"code\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <chip\n      name=\"U1\"\n      footprint=\"pushbutton\"\n      internallyConnectedPins={[\n        [\"pin1\", \"pin4\"],\n        [\"pin2\", \"pin3\"]\n      ]}\n    />\n  </board>\n)\n\n`} />\n\n\n:::note\nYou may not want to do this for power or ground pins on boards where you're\nexpected to connect the pins specifically externally. For example, if you have\nseveral V5 pins that each need a decoupling capacitor, it would be better to\nmanage the connections explicitly with traces (perhaps using `maxTraceLength`!)\neven if they are internally connected.\n:::\n\n### Externally Connected Pins\n\nTo indicate that pins should be externally connected, you can use the `externallyConnectedPins` props.\nJust like the `internallyConnectedPins` prop, this is an array of arrays of pin labels, where each\nsub-array represents a group of pins that should be connected together.\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"code\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <chip\n      name=\"U1\"\n      footprint=\"soic8\"\n      pinLabels={{\n        pin1: \"VCC\",\n        pin2: \"DISCH\",\n        pin3: \"THRES\",\n        pin4: \"CTRL\",\n        pin5: \"GND\",\n        pin6: \"TRIG\",\n        pin7: \"OUT\",\n        pin8: \"RESET\"\n      }}\n      externallyConnectedPins={[\n        [\"GND\", \"DISCH\"],\n        [\"TRIG\", \"VCC\"]\n      ]}\n    />\n  </board>\n)\n\n`} />\n\n## Specifying the Manufacturer Part Number or Supplier Part Numbers\n\ntscircuit will attempt to find matching parts based on the `manufacturerPartNumber`\nand `footprint` that was provided.

A component hook is created with the `createUseComponent`\nfrom `tscircuit` and returns a hook that when used, will generate a component\nwith properties for each pin label.\n\n```tsx\nimport { createUseComponent, type CommonLayoutProps } from \"tscircuit\"\n\ninterface Props extends CommonLayoutProps {\n  name: string\n}\n\n\nconst pinLabels = {\n  pin1: \"VCC\",\n  pin2: \"DISCH\",\n  pin3: \"THRES\",\n  pin4: \"CTRL\",\n  pin5: \"GND\",\n  pin6: \"TRIG\",\n  pin7: \"OUT\",\n  pin8: \"RESET\"\n} as const\n\nexport const A555Timer = (props: Props) => (\n  <chip\n    footprint=\"soic8\"\n    pinLabels={pinLabels}\n    {...props}\n  />\n)\n\nexport const use555Timer = createUseComponent(A555Timer, pinLabels)\n```\n\n:::warning\nMake sure to have `as const` when you're defining your `pinLabels`, if you're\nmissing this the types won't work!\n:::\n\nWhen you use Component Hooks, you get better type checking in your component usage\nbecause all the pin labels are now available on the component!\n\n```tsx\nimport { use555Timer } from \"./a555timer\"\nimport { usePowerRegulator } from \"./power-regulator\"\n\nexport default () => {\n  const U1 = use555Timer(\"U1\")\n  const M1 = usePowerRegulator(\"M1\")\n\n  return (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <U1 />\n      <M1 />\n\n      <trace from={U1.GND} to=\"net.GND\" />\n      <trace from={U1.VCC} to={M1.V5} />\n    </board>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n\n## Importing Chips from JLCPCB, KiCad or Circuit JSON\n\nThere are a lot of ways to import a chip configuration, each with their own\nguide!

This specifies how accurate the resistance needs to be\n- **powerRating** - a wattage e.g. \"5W\" indicating how much power can transfer through the resistor for normal operation\n- **temperatureOperatingRange** - a string indicating the listed range for the resistor's operating temperature `\"-15F-150F\"`\n\n## Automatic Part Selection\n\nYou generally don't need to specify `supplierPartNumbers` with a resistor, tscircuit\nwill use the [platform parts engine](../guides/platform-configuration.md) to\nautomatically search vendors for a part matching your tolerances.\n\n================\nFile: docs/elements/resonator.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: <resonator />\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nResonators are common components used to provide a stable frequency reference for\ncircuits.

Subcircuits are\noften used for a small functional block, such as a voltage regulator.\n\nWithin a subcircuit, you can have a custom autorouter or isolated nets from the\nlarger circuits. You can also re-use reference designators. Your subcircuit is\nessentially isolated from other subcircuits.\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\"\n\n<CircuitPreview\n  defaultView=\"schematic\"\n  code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <subcircuit name=\"subcircuit1\" schX={-2}>\n        <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" />\n      </subcircuit>\n      <subcircuit name=\"subcircuit2\" schX={2}>\n        <resistor name=\"R2\" resistance=\"1k\"  />\n      </subcircuit>\n      <trace from=\".subcircuit1 .R1 .pin1\" to=\".subcircuit2 .R2 .pin1\" />\n    </board>\n  )\n  `}\n/>\n\n## Re-using Reference Designators\n\nRe-using reference designators is typically considered a bad practice, but in\ntscircuit reference designators are intelligently prefixed prior to being\nwritten on the silkscreen. This means that you can design your subcircuits\nwithout worrying about whether or not a reference designator has been previously\nused.\n\n<CircuitPreview\n  defaultView=\"schematic\"\n  code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <subcircuit name=\"subcircuit1\" schX={-2}>\n        <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" />\n      </subcircuit>\n      <subcircuit name=\"subcircuit2\" schX={2}>\n        <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" />\n      </subcircuit>\n      <trace from=\".subcircuit1 .R1 .pin1\" to=\".subcircuit2 .R1 .pin1\" />\n    </board>\n  )\n  `}\n/>\n\n## Configuring the Autorouter\n\nSubcircuits can have a custom autorouter configuration. This will be inherited\nby any children subcircuits.\n\nTo specify a custom autorouter configuration, just set the `autorouter` property\non a `<subcircuit />` element.\n\n```tsx\n<subcircuit autorouter=\"auto-cloud\">\n  <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" />\n  <resistor name=\"R2\" resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" />\n  {/* ... */}\n</subcircuit>\n```\n\nSpecifying custom autorouter settings for subcircuits can be extremely useful\nwhen you have a tricky section of components that have special requirements.\n\nRead more about [the autorouter prop here](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter).\n\n================\nFile: docs/elements/switch.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: <switch />\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nA switch is a mechanical device that can be used to connect or disconnect a\ncircuit.\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\";\n\n<CircuitPreview\n  defaultView=\"schematic\"\n  code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <switch name=\"SW1\" type=\"spst\" />\n  )\n  `}\n/>\n\n## Properties\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| `type` | `\"spst\"` \\| `\"spdt\"` \\| `\"dpst\"` \\| `\"dpdt\"` | The type of switch |\n| `isNormallyClosed` | `boolean` | Whether the switch is normally closed |\n\n\n## Types of Switches\n\n| Type | Description |\n| ---- | ----------- |\n| `spst` | Single Pole Single Throw - The simplest switch type with one input and one output |\n| `spdt` | Single Pole Double Throw - One input that can be connected to either of two outputs |\n| `dpst` | Double Pole Single Throw - Two separate inputs each connecting to their own output |\n| `dpdt` | Double Pole Double Throw - Two separate inputs that can each connect to either of two outputs |\n\n<CircuitPreview\n  defaultView=\"schematic\"\n  code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <group>\n      <switch name=\"SW1\" type=\"spst\" schX={-1} schY={-1} />\n      <switch name=\"SW1\" type=\"spdt\" schX={1} schY={-1} />\n      <switch name=\"SW3\" type=\"dpst\" schX={-1} schY={1} />\n      <switch name=\"SW4\" type=\"dpdt\" schX={1} schY={1} />\n    </group>\n  )\n  `}\n/>\n\n\n## When to use `<switch />` vs `<pushbutton />`\n\nYou should always use `<pushbutton />` or any more specific switch element\nwhen possible. `<switch />` is a more generic element with less defaults.\n\n================\nFile: docs/elements/trace.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: <trace />\nsidebar_position: 5\n---\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\"\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `<trace />` element represents an electrical connection between two or more points in your circuit. Traces can connect components, nets, or specific pins on components.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nHere's a simple example connecting two components:\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" pcbX={-2} schX={-2} />\n      <capacitor name=\"C1\" capacitance=\"100nF\" footprint=\"0402\" pcbX={2} />\n      <trace\n        from=\".R1 > .pin1\"\n        to=\".C1 > .pin1\"\n      />\n    </board>\n  )\n`} />\n\n## Trace Properties\n\n| Property | Description | Example |\n| -------- | ----------- | ------- |\n| `from` | Starting point of the trace using a [port selector](../guides/port-and-net-selectors.md) | `\".R1 > .pin1\"` |\n| `to` | Ending point of the trace using a [port selector](../guides/port-and-net-selectors.md) | `\".C1 > .pin1\"` |\n| `maxLength` | Maximum length the trace can be (optional) | `\"10mm\"` |\n| `minLength` | Minimum length the trace must be (optional) | `\"5mm\"` |\n| `width` | Width of the trace (optional) | `\"0.2mm\"` |\n\n## Connecting to Nets\n\nTraces can connect to named nets like power and ground:\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"schematic\" code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n      <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" />\n      <trace from=\".R1 > .pin1\" to=\"net.GND\" />\n      <trace from=\".R1 > .pin2\" to=\"net.VCC\" />\n    </board>\n  )\n`} />\n\n## Autorouting\n\nTraces are automatically routed by tscircuit's [autorouting system](./board.mdx#setting-the-autorouter). The autorouter will:\n\n1. Find a path between components that doesn't intersect other traces\n2. Use vias to change layers when needed\n3. Respect any length constraints specified\n4. Try to minimize the number of vias used\n\nYou can customize the autorouting behavior by setting the `autorouter` property on the parent [`<board />`](./board.mdx) or [`<subcircuit />`](./subcircuit.mdx).\n\n## Length Constraints \n\nSometimes you need traces to be exactly a certain length, like for high-speed signals. You can use `maxLength` and `minLength`:\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"20mm\" height=\"20mm\">\n    <chip name=\"U1\" footprint=\"soic8\" pcbX={-5} />\n    <chip name=\"U2\" footprint=\"soic8\" pcbX={5} />\n    <trace\n      from=\".U1 > .pin1\"\n      to=\".U2 > .pin1\"\n      maxLength=\"15mm\"\n      minLength=\"12mm\"\n    />\n  </board>\n)\n`} />\n\n## Differential Pairs\n\nFor high-speed signals, you often need pairs of traces to have matched lengths. You can use the `differentialPairKey` property to group traces:\n\n:::info\nThe `differentialPairKey` property is in beta and not available on all autorouters yet!\n:::\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board width=\"20mm\" height=\"20mm\">\n      <chip name=\"U1\" footprint=\"soic8\" pcbX={-5} />\n      <chip name=\"U2\" footprint=\"soic8\" pcbX={5} />\n      <trace\n        from=\".U1 > .pin1\"\n        to=\".U2 > .pin1\"\n        differentialPairKey=\"pair1\"\n      />\n      <trace\n        from=\".U1 > .pin2\"\n        to=\".U2 > .pin2\"\n        differentialPairKey=\"pair1\"\n      />\n    </board>\n  )\n`} />\n\nThe autorouter will ensure both traces in the pair have the same length.\n\n## Net vs Direct connections\n\nThere are generally two ways that traces are represented on a PCB \"Rats Nest\" \nor on a schematic and they have very different results:\n\n- **Net** - A trace that connects a net to a component pin.\n  - `<trace from=\"net.GND\" to=\".R1 > .pin1\" />`\n- **Direct** - A trace that connects two component pins directly.\n  - `<trace from=\".R1 > .pin1\" to=\".C2 > .pin2\" />`\n\nWhen you specify a trace with a net, the autorouter will look for the best\nplace to tie into the net. This means you're not specifying the exact location\nwhere the trace will go.\n\nWhen using net connections we use a Rats Nest on a PCB view or a net label on a\nschematic view. When you see a dotted line on a Rats Nest, you should think of\nit as a _possible_ connection point, but not necessarily the final place where\nthe autorouter will connect to the net.\n\n================\nFile: docs/elements/transistor.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: <transistor />\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nA transistor is a three-terminal semiconductor device that can amplify or switch electronic signals.

This object maps file paths\nto file contents. Files inside this \"filesystem map\" can import each other, this\nis super useful when you have many files to import such as a `manual-edits.json`\nfile!\n\n```tsx\nimport { RunFrame } from \"@tscircuit/runframe\"\n\nexport default () => (\n  <RunFrame\n    fsMap={{\n      \"main.tsx\":\n`\ncircuit.add(\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <resistor name=\"R1\" resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" />\n    <capacitor name=\"C1\" capacitance=\"1uF\" footprint=\"0603\" pcbX={4} />\n    <trace from=\".R1 .pin1\" to=\".C1 .pin1\" />\n  </board>\n)\n`,\n    }}\n    entrypoint=\"main.tsx\"\n  />\n)\n```\n\nYou can see different examples of how RunFrame looks for different circuits\non the [RunFrame online examples page](https://runframe.vercel.app/)\n\n`<RunFrame />` automatically handles imports from the tscircuit registry\n\n\n\n## Displaying Circuit JSON without React\n\nAre you interested in this?

The `<chip />` element is commonly used for ICs, connectors, buttons, and other discrete components.\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/layout-properties.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: Using Layout Properties\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThere are many ways to layout your schematic and PCB with tscircuit including\n[automatic layout](./automatic-layout.mdx) and [manual edits](./manual-edits.mdx). In this\narticle we'll discuss how to programmatically lay out a board using layout properties like\n`schX`/`schY` and `pcbX` and `pcbY`\n\nAll position properties default to `mm` but you can pass a string with any distance\nunit. For example, `pcbX=\"0.1in\"` is the same as `pcbX=\"2.54mm\"`.\n\n\n## PCB Layout Properties\n\nThe following properties can be placed on nearly any tscircuit element to control\nits position on the board:\n\n| Property | Description | Example Value |\n| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |\n| `pcbX`   | Set the center X position of the element | `0` |\n| `pcbY`   | Set the center Y position of the element | `0` |\n| `pcbRotation` | Set the rotation of the element | `\"90deg\"` |\n\nHere's an example of moving a resistor with default properties versus custom\nlayout properties:\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\";\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n    <resistor\n      name=\"R1\"\n      footprint=\"0805\"\n      resistance=\"1k\"\n    />\n)\n\n`} />\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n    <resistor\n      name=\"R1\"\n      footprint=\"0805\"\n      resistance=\"1k\"\n      pcbX=\"3mm\"\n      pcbY=\"2.5mm\"\n      pcbRotation=\"90deg\"\n    />\n)\n\n`} />\n\n:::info\nTo see positions and measure distances in the PCB Viewer, you can press \"d\" on\nyour keyboard to toggle measurement mode.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/pcb-dimension-mode.png\" alt=\"PCB Viewer Measurement Mode\" />\n<figcaption>PCB Viewer Measurement Mode, press \"d\" to toggle when using the PCB tool</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Schematic Layout Properties\n\nThe following properties can be placed on a schematic element to control its position on the board:\n\n| Property | Description | Example Value |\n| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |\n| `schX`   | Set the center X position of the element | `0` |\n| `schY`   | Set the center Y position of the element | `0` |\n| `schRotation` | Set the rotation of the element | `\"90deg\"` |\n\nHere's an example of moving a resistor with default properties versus custom\nschematic layout properties:\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"schematic\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n    <resistor\n      name=\"R1\"\n      footprint=\"0805\"\n      resistance=\"1k\"\n    />\n)\n\n`} />\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"schematic\" code={`\n\nexport default () => (\n    <resistor\n      name=\"R1\"\n      footprint=\"0805\"\n      resistance=\"1k\"\n      // schX=\"3mm\"\n      // schY=\"2.5mm\"\n      schRotation=\"90deg\"\n    />\n)\n\n`} />\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/manual-edits.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: Manual Edits\n---\n\nIt can be cumbersome to programmatically define the locations of every component\non the PCB and schematic, but [automatic layout](./automatic-layout.mdx) can\nbe too uncontrolled. Manual edits allow you to use a schematic or PCB viewer\nto drag and drop components.\n\n:::info\nAre you trying to programmatically define the locations of components? Check out\n[using layout properties](./layout-properties.mdx) instead.\n:::\n\nEvery time you drag a component, a file conventionally called `manual-edits.json`\nis edited with your edits. This manual edits file is imported and can be given\nas the `manualEdits` prop to a `<board />` or `<subcircuit />`\n\n## Creating Manual Edits with a GUI\n\nEach GUI features an \"edit button\" to turn on an editing mode. After you turn\non the editing mode, you can drag and drop components and your edits will\nautomatically edit the `manual-edits.json` file.\n\n### Creating Manual Edits in the Schematic Viewer\n\nIn the top-right corner there is a pencil edit button. This turns on the edit\nmode.\n\n:::note\nTODO insert a video here showing the manual edits in action!\n:::\n\n### Creating Manual Edits in the PCB Viewer\n\nThe PCB Viewer features two edits modes:\n\n- Edit Trace Mode\n- Move Components Mode\n\nYou can find both of them by hovering over the PCB viewer.\n\n:::note\nTODO insert a video here showing the manual edits in action!\n:::\n\n### Troubleshooting manual edits not being applied\n\nUsually if manual edits aren't being applied, it's because you haven't imported\nthe `manual-edits.json` file. On the [tscircuit.com editor](https://tscircuit.com),\nyou'll get a warning that automatically edits your code to insert the import.\n\nIf you're editing locally, add the following lines:\n\n```tsx\nimport manualEdits from \"./manual-edits.json\"\n\nexport default () => (\n  //                                VVVV add this prop!\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\" manualEdits={manualEdits}>\n    {/* ... */}\n  </board>\n)\n```\n\nIf you're still not seeing your manual edits, select the `manual-edits.json`\nfile from the tscircuit editor or find the file on your filesystem. Make sure\nthat it changes when you drag'n'drop components.\n\n\n## The Manual Edits Format\n\n\nThe manual edits file's format is defined in [this typescript file](https://github.com/tscircuit/props/blob/main/lib/manual-edits/manual_edits_file.ts), it contains 3 main types of edits:\n\n- **pcb_placements** - Component positions on the PCB\n- **manual_trace_hints** - \"Hints\" indicating where PCB traces should go\n- **schematic_placements** - Component positions on the schematic\n\nHere's an example of a manual edits file:\n\n```json\n{\n  pcb_placements: [\n    {\n      \"selector\": \"R1\",\n      \"center\": {\n        \"x\": 0,\n        \"y\": 6.869495369849336\n      },\n      \"relative_to\": \"group_center\",\n      \"_edit_event_id\": \"0.037205222437411756\"\n    }\n  ]\n  manual_trace_hints: []\n  schematic_placements: [\n    {\n      selector: \"R1\",\n      center: { x: 5, y: 5 },\n      relative_to: \"group_center\",\n    },\n    {\n      selector: \"C1\",\n      center: { x: -5, y: -5 },\n      relative_to: \"group_center\",\n    },\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/platform-configuration.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Platform Configuration\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Platform Configuration allows you to change tscircuit behavior to best suite\nthe platform the tscircuit code is running on.\n\nSome use cases:\n\n- Organizations may want to customize the cloud-autorouter to avoid sending sensitive designs outside your company\n- Organizations may want to use their own internal registry for importing circuits instead of [tscircuit.com](https://tscircuit.com)\n- For [autorouting.com](https://autorouting.com), we configure the platform to not perform any autorouting\n\n## Customizing the Platform\n\nAll of the following features of the platform can be configured:\n\n- **partsEngine** - The engine used to automatically find parts matching component specifications\n- **registryApiUrl** - The registry to use, defaults to `https://registry-api.tscircuit.com`. See [Registry API](../web-apis/the-registry-api.md) for more details\n- **cloudAutorouterUrl** - The cloud autorouter to use, defaults to a tscircuit cloud service that uses freerouting\n- Disable specific circuit outputs to optimize build times, such as disabling autorouting\n\n### The Default Platform\n\nThe tscircuit default platform configuration sources parts from multiple vendors\nand uses the tscircuit backend for autorouting and `@tsci/*` imports.\n\nCurrent vendors used for automatic part sourcing:\n\n- [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)\n- Digikey (coming soon!)\n- Mouser (coming soon!)\n\nFor each vendor, tscircuit populates multiple available chips. This means even\nif tscircuit finds parts for a vendor, you don't have to use that vendor!\n\n## Using your Platform\n\n:::info\nWant more platform features? Tell us about your use case in [this GitHub Discussion!](https://github.com/orgs/tscircuit/discussions/514)\n:::\n\nWhen you initialize a `RootCircuit`, you can provide the platform configuration\nas the `{ platform }` parameter:\n\n```tsx\nimport { RootCircuit } from \"@tscircuit/core\"\n\nconst circuit = new RootCircuit({\n  platform: {\n    registryApiUrl: \"https://my-tscircuit-registry.mycompany.com\",\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThis can also be provided to modules like `@tscircuit/eval` to evaluate tscircuit\ncode:\n\n```tsx\nimport { CircuitRunner } from \"@tscircuit/eval-webworker\"\nimport myPartsEngine from \"./my-parts-engine\"\n\nconst circuitRunner = new CircuitRunner({\n  platform: {\n    partsEngine: getMyPartsEngine,\n  },\n})\n\nawait circuitRunner.execute(`\ncircuit.add(\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <led name=\"LED1\" footprint=\"0603\" color=\"red\" />\n  </board>\n)`)\n\nawait circuitRunner.renderUntilSettled()\n\nconst circuitJson = await circuitRunner.getCircuitJson()\n```\n\n:::info\nInterested in running the entire tscircuit platform privately inside your company?\nWe're happy to help!

They're most\ncommonly used in traces like this:\n\n```tsx\n<trace from=\".R1 > .pin1\" to=\".C1 > .pos\" />\n```\n\nHowever they can also be used anywhere where a port is referenced, for example to indicate what a capacitor should decouple or a resistor should pullup to:\n\n```tsx\n<resistor pullupFor=\".U1 > .GPIO1\" pullupTo=\"net.VCC\" />\n\n<capactor decouplingFor=\".U1 .VCC\" decouplingTo=\"net.GND\" />\n```\n\nSelectors use the same semantics as CSS selectors:\n\n- `>` means \"direct child\"\n- `.` means \"name\" (in CSS, this can be any class name, but in tscircuit components are limited to a single name)\n- `.U1` means \"something with the name `U1`\"\n- `net.GND` means \"a net with the name `GND`\"\n\n## Selectors don't cross subcircuit boundaries unless told to\n\nWhen a selector is specified, it's resolved relative to the\nsubcircuit of the component where it's specified.\n\nThis means within a subcircuit the selector `.U1` will match any component with the name `U1` anywhere in that subcircuit without going into other subcircuits.\n\nSubcircuits can be nested and have names, so you can use this\nto reference components in nested subcircuits:\n\n```tsx\n<subcircuit>\n  <subcircuit name=\"S1\">\n    <resistor name=\"R1\" />\n  </subcircuit>\n  <capacitor name=\"C1\" />\n\n  {/* We must include \".S1\" in the selector to select the resistor from the inner subcircuit */}\n  <trace from=\".S1 .R1 .pin1\" to=\".C1 .pos\" />\n</subcircuit>\n```\n\nBecause subcircuits are isolated from each other, you can\nre-use reference designators in different subcircuits (globally\nunique reference designators are generated on export)\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/programmatically-building-circuits.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Programmatically Building Circuits\n---\n\nThis guide is about using tscircuit inside of scripts, APIs or inside the browser. Maybe you want to create a website that allows your users drag'n'drop to create custom electronics and turn their designs into real circuits automatically.\n\nFor most users, there is no need to programmatically build circuits, you can use the [command line](../command-line/tsci-dev.md) or the [online editor](../intro/quickstart-web.md) to build and export your circuits into any supported format.\n\nIf you're not using Typescript or prefer a \"zero-installation\" setup, you can fully build your circuits with complex parameters using the [Registry API](../web-apis/the-registry-api.md)\n\n## Using `@tscircuit/core` directly\n\n`@tscircuit/core` is the core library for tscircuit, it converts React code into [Circuit JSON](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json), a universally intermediary format that represents an electronic device.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `@tscircuit/core` directly to build a circuit into Circuit JSON:\n\n```tsx\nimport { RootCircuit } from \"@tscircuit/core\"\n\nconst circuit = new RootCircuit()\n\ncircuit.add(\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <resistor resistance=\"1k\" footprint=\"0402\" name=\"R1\" schX={3} pcbX={3} />\n    <capacitor\n      capacitance=\"1000pF\"\n      footprint=\"0402\"\n      name=\"C1\"\n      schX={-3}\n      pcbX={-3}\n    />\n    <trace from=\".R1 > .pin1\" to=\".C1 > .pin1\" />\n  </board>\n)\n\nawait circuit.renderUntilSettled()\n\nconsole.log(circuit.getCircuitJson())\n```\n\nThis will output a long [Circuit JSON](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json) array that you can convert into many\nother formats or display directly inside a [CircuitJsonPreview](./displaying-circuit-json-on-a-webpage.mdx) component.\n\n## Evaluating Typescript Circuits\n\n`@tscircuit/eval` can be used to evaluate Typescript/React code and\nautomatically import modules from the tscircuit registry.\n\n```tsx\nimport { CircuitRunner } from \"@tscircuit/eval\"\n\nconst circuitRunner = new CircuitRunner()\n\nawait circuitRunner.execute(`\nimport { RedLed } from \"@tsci/seveibar.red-led\"\n\ncircuit.add(\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <RedLed name=\"LED1\" />\n  </board>\n)`)\n\nawait circuitRunner.renderUntilSettled()\n\nconst circuitJson = await circuitRunner.getCircuitJson()\n\n// Display or convert the circuit json to any other format!\n```\n\n### Evaluating tscircuit inside a web worker\n\n```tsx\nimport { createCircuitWebWorker } from \"@tscircuit/eval/webworker\"\n\nconst circuitWebWorker = createCircuitWebWorker()\n\nawait circuitWebWorker.execute(`\nimport { RedLed } from \"@tsci/seveibar.red-led\"\n\ncircuit.add(\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <RedLed />\n  </board>\n)\n`)\n\nawait circuitWebWorker.renderUntilSettled()\n\nconst circuitJson = await circuitWebWorker.getCircuitJson()\n```\n\n## Converting Circuit JSON to other formats\n\nYou can convert [Circuit JSON](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json) to many\nother formats:\n\n- [Gerber files](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-gerber)\n- [Specctra DSN Autorouting files](https://github.com/tscircuit/dsn-converter)\n- [Pick'n'Place Files](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-pnp)\n- [PCB and Schematic SVGs](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-to-svg)\n- [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-bom)\n- [SPICE netlists and simulations](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json-to-spice)\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/publishing-modules.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Publishing Modules\nsidebar_position: 6\n---\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/running-tscircuit-inside-an-iframe.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: Running tscircuit inside an iframe\n---\n\n## Overview\n\ntscircuit can be evaluated inside an iframe. This makes it easy to embed\nsnippets on a webpage without complex build systems.\n\nHere's an example of an iframe running a tscircuit snippet:\n\nimport { TscircuitIframe } from \"../../src/components/TscircuitIframe\"\n\n<TscircuitIframe\n  fsMap={{\n    \"main.tsx\": `circuit.add(\n      <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n        <resistor name=\"R1\" footprint=\"0402\" resistance=\"1k\" />\n      </board>\n    )`,\n  }}\n  entrypoint=\"main.tsx\"\n/>\n\n## Running tscircuit inside an iframe\n\nTo run tscircuit inside an iframe, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Add an iframe that points to `\"https://runframe.tscircuit.com/iframe.html\"`\n2. Listen for the `runframe_ready_to_receive` message from the iframe\n3. Send the code you want to run to the iframe via `postMessage`\n\nHere's a fully working example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>RunFrame Host</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <iframe\n      id=\"runframe\"\n      src=\"https://runframe.tscircuit.com/iframe.html\"\n      style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;\"\n    ></iframe>\n\n    <script>\n      const iframe = document.getElementById(\"runframe\")\n\n      // Listen for ready message from iframe\n      window.addEventListener(\"message\", (event) => {\n        if (event.data?.runframe_type === \"runframe_ready_to_receive\") {\n          // Send circuit configuration\n          iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(\n            {\n              runframe_type: \"runframe_props_changed\",\n              runframe_props: {\n                fsMap: {\n                  \"main.tsx\": `circuit.add(<resistor resistance=\"1k\" />)`,\n                },\n                entrypoint: \"main.tsx\",\n              },\n            },\n            \"*\"\n          )\n        }\n      })\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## React iframe wrapper for tscircuit\n\nAn iframe wrapper is available to simplify the process of running tscircuit\ninside an iframe. To use it, add the `@tscircuit/runframe` package to your\nproject and use the [`RunFrameWithIframe` component](https://github.com/tscircuit/runframe/blob/main/lib/components/RunFrameWithIframe/RunFrameWithIframe.tsx) like so:\n\n```tsx\nimport { RunFrameWithIframe } from \"@tscircuit/runframe/iframe\"\n\nexport default () => (\n  <RunFrameWithIframe\n    fsMap={{\n      \"main.tsx\": `circuit.add(<resistor resistance=\"1k\" />)`,\n    }}\n    entrypoint=\"main.tsx\"\n  />\n)\n```\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/understanding-fabrication-files.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Understanding Fabrication Files\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nFabrication files are files that can be uploaded to a fabricator or turn-key\nmanufacturer to get an entire circuit board made. tscircuit includes three\nmain types of files inside our fabrication files `zip`:\n\n- **Gerbers** These represent each copper layer of the PCB. We also include\n  drilling holes and board cutouts\n- **Bill Of Materials CSV**\n- **Pick'n'Place CSV** These\n\n## How to get fabrication files\n\n### Web\n\nOn the web, you can just hit \"Download\" on any circuit, then hit \"Fabrication Files\"\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/img/online-editor-download.png\" alt=\"Online Editor Download Button\" />\n<figcaption>Downloading fabrication files from the online editor</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### CLI\n\nYou can run [tsci export ./main.tsx --to fabrication-zip](../command-line/tsci-export) to export to a fabrication files zip file containing Gerbers, Bill of Materials and\nthe Pick'n'Place CSV.\n\n## Uploading Fabrication Files\n\n<figure>\n<img className=\"img-rounded\" src=\"/img/jlcpcb-upload.png\" />\n<figcaption>Many fabricators allow you to directly drop fabrication files on their website!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/using-sel-references.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: Using \"sel\" References\n---\n\nThe `sel` object is a special import that allows you to easily reference\ncomponents with a bit more type-safety than a string. It can also be more ergonomic\nthan typing out a [port selector](./port-and-net-selectors.md).\n\nimport CircuitPreview from \"@site/src/components/CircuitPreview\"\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"code\" code={`\nimport { sel } from \"tscircuit\"\n\nexport default () => (\n  <board width=\"10mm\" height=\"10mm\">\n    <resistor\n      resistance=\"1k\"\n      footprint=\"0402\"\n      name=\"R1\"\n    />\n    <capacitor\n      capacitance=\"1000pF\"\n      footprint=\"0402\"\n      name=\"C1\"\n    />\n    <trace from={sel.R1.pin1} to={sel.C1.pos} />\n  </board>\n)\n`} />\n\n\nThe `sel` can be thought of as a very large mapping of conventional strings.\n\nHere are some `sel` expressions and their corresponding string:\n\n```tsx\nimport { sel } from \"tscircuit\"\n\nsel.R1.pin1\n// \".R1 > .pin1\"\n\nsel.C1.pos\n// \".C1 > .pos\"\n\nsel.net.GND\n// \"net.GND\"\n\nsel.U1.GPIO1\n// \".U1 > .GPIO1\"\n```\n\nSo `sel` is really just a slightly more type-safe, conventional way of writing\n[port selectors](./port-and-net-selectors.md). Where possible, it's much better to use [component hooks](../elements/chip.mdx#type-safe-chips-custom-component-hooks)\nbecause they can guarantee more type-safety and have the exact pins that a chip\nsupports.\n\n================\nFile: docs/guides/using-tscircuit-without-react.mdx\n================\n---\ntitle: Using tscircuit without React\n---\n\n{/* tscircuit uses React by default for strong guarantees about how\ncomponents are imported and used, but you can also use tscircuit\nwithout react. */}\n\n:::tip\nIf you're interested in using tscircuit without react, please let us know\nby [upvoting this issue!](https://github.com/tscircuit/tscircuit/issues/508)\n:::\n\n:::info\nAre you interested in using tscircuit inside an iframe?

From those\n40 lines, we were able to create a full PCB, Schematic and 3D preview. Not only\nthat, but we can export this circuit to [Fabrication Files](../guides/understanding-fabrication-files)\nand get it fabricated and assembled. In fact we did!\n\nimport usbcflashlight from \"@site/static/img/usbcflashlight_20250123_1816894.jpg\"\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\", marginBottom: 18 }}>\n<img style={{maxWidth: 400}} src={usbcflashlight} alt=\"USB Flashlight PCB After Manufacturing\" />\n</div>\n\nIt may not seem like much, but tscircuit just handled a _lot_ of work for us!\n\n- Automatic Part Selection and Bill of Materials Generation\n- Autorouting\n- Schematic and PCB Layout\n- 3D Model Generation\n- Fabrication File Generation\n\n...and it ran completely in our browser!\n\ntscircuit isn't limited to simple circuits like this.

In tscircuit\nyou can use local or cloud autorouters, use different autorouters for different\nsubcircuits, and disable autorouting entirely.\n\nThis page provides details on the autorouting cloud API so you can import your\nown cloud autorouter.\n\n## Using Custom Autorouters\n\nHere's an example of how a customer autorouter can be configured with tscircuit:\n\n<CircuitPreview defaultView=\"pcb\" code={`\n  export default () => (\n    <board\n      width=\"20mm\"\n      height=\"20mm\"\n      autorouter={{\n        serverUrl: \"https://registry-api.tscircuit.com\",\n        serverMode: \"job\",\n        inputFormat: \"simplified\",\n      }}\n    >\n      <chip name=\"U1\" footprint=\"soic8\" pcbX={5} pcbY={0} />\n      <resistor\n        name=\"R1\"\n        pcbX={-5}\n        pcbY={0}\n        resistance={100}\n        footprint=\"0402\"\n      />\n      <trace from=\".U1 > .pin1\" to=\".R1 > .pin1\" />\n    </board>\n  )\n`} />\n\n### The Autorouter Object\n\nThe autorouter object is used to configure the autorouter. The following properties are supported:\n\n- `serverUrl`: The URL of the autorouter server.\n- `serverMode`: [`job`]( or `solve-endpoint`\n- `inputFormat`: The format of the input to the autorouter server.\n\n## Input and Output Formats\n\n### Simplified Input/Output\n\nThe `simplified` input format is simple to build an autorouter for. It contains\na JSON object with the desired connections to make and the obstacles the algorithm must\navoid to solve the routing problem.\n\nWhen using the `simplified` input format, the `/autorouting/jobs/create` and/or `/autorouting/solve`\nendpoint must accept a `input_simple_route_json` file with the following interface:\n\n```tsx\ninterface SimpleRouteJson {\n  layerCount: number\n  minTraceWidth: number\n  obstacles: Obstacle[]\n  connections: Array<SimpleRouteConnection>\n  bounds: { minX: number; maxX: number; minY: number; maxY: number }\n}\n\ninterface Obstacle {\n  type: \"rect\"\n  layers: string[]\n  center: { x: number; y: number }\n  width: number\n  height: number\n  connectedTo: string[]\n}\n\ninterface SimpleRouteConnection {\n  name: string\n  pointsToConnect: Array<{ x: number; y: number; layer: string }>\n}\n```\n\nHere's an example of a `SimpleRouteJson` object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"layerCount\": 2,\n  \"minTraceWidth\": 0.2,\n  \"obstacles\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"rect\",\n      \"layers\": [\"top\"],\n      \"center\": { \"x\": 30, \"y\": 25 },\n      \"width\": 10,\n      \"height\": 8,\n      \"connectedTo\": [\"power\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"rect\",\n      \"layers\": [\"bottom\"],\n      \"center\": { \"x\": 70, \"y\": 25 },\n      \"width\": 12,\n      \"height\": 6,\n      \"connectedTo\": [\"ground\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"connections\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"power_net\",\n      \"pointsToConnect\": [\n        { \"x\": 10, \"y\": 10, \"layer\": \"top\" },\n        { \"x\": 90, \"y\": 40, \"layer\": \"bottom\" }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"ground_net\",\n      \"pointsToConnect\": [\n        { \"x\": 20, \"y\": 20, \"layer\": \"top\" },\n        { \"x\": 80, \"y\": 30, \"layer\": \"top\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"bounds\": {\n    \"minX\": 0,\n    \"maxX\": 100,\n    \"minY\": 0,\n    \"maxY\": 50\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen in `simplified` mode you should respond with an\n`output_simple_route_json` object that adds a `traces` field to the original\ninput object.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output_simple_route_json\": {\n    // ...the original input object fields\n    \"traces\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"pcb_trace\",\n        \"pcb_trace_id\": \"trace_1\",\n        \"route\": [\n          {\n            \"route_type\": \"via\",\n            \"x\": 45,\n            \"y\": 25,\n            \"from_layer\": \"top\",\n            \"to_layer\": \"bottom\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"route_type\": \"wire\",\n            \"x\": 45,\n            \"y\": 25,\n            \"width\": 0.2,\n            \"layer\": \"bottom\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"route_type\": \"wire\",\n            \"x\": 60,\n            \"y\": 35,\n            \"width\": 0.2,\n            \"layer\": \"bottom\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `traces` field should match this type:\n\n```tsx\ntype SimplifiedPcbTraces = Array<{\n  type: \"pcb_trace\"\n  pcb_trace_id: string\n  route: Array<\n    | {\n        route_type: \"wire\"\n        x: number\n        y: number\n        width: number\n        layer: string\n      }\n    | {\n        route_type: \"via\"\n        x: number\n        y: number\n        to_layer: string\n        from_layer: string\n      }\n  >\n}>\n```\n\n\n### Circuit JSON Input/Output\n\nWhen using `inputFormat: \"circuit_json\"` you the API must accept `{ input_circuit_json }` and\nrespond with PCB traces in the format `{ output_pcb_traces }` that can be concatenated to the Circuit JSON to complete the circuit.\n\n## Choosing a `serverMode`\n\nWhen you're implementing the autorouter API, you can choose to implement either\nthe `job` API (recommended) or the `solve-endpoint` API. The `solve-endpoint` is easier because\nit's a single endpoint, but has many limitations because it must perform the\nautorouting in the lifecycle of a single request.\n\nWhen defining your autorouter object, you can choose the `serverMode` and `inputFormat`\nto correspond to what you've implemented.\n\n## The `solve-endpoint` API\n\n| Endpoint |  Description |\n| -------- | ----------- |\n| `/autorouting/solve` | Takes autorouting input and returns the solved routes | \n\n### `solve-endpoint` with `simplified` input\n\n```\nPOST /autorouting/solve\n\n{\n  \"input_simple_route_json\": {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n{\n  \"output_simple_route_json\": {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `solve-endpoint` with `circuit_json` input\n\n```\nPOST /autorouting/solve\n\n{\n  \"input_circuit_json\": {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n{\n  \"output_pcb_traces\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"pcb_trace\",\n      \"pcb_trace_id\": \"trace_1\",\n      \"route\": [\n        // ...\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## The `job` API\n\nThe `job` autorouting API allows you to perform long-running autorouting jobs for\nlarge circuits. When using the `job` API, you must use the `\"circuit_json\"` input format.\n\n| Endpoint |  Description |\n| -------- | ----------- |\n| `/autorouting/jobs/create` | Create the autorouting job | \n| `/autorouting/jobs/get`    | Get the status of the autorouting job |\n| `/autorouting/jobs/cancel` | Cancel the autorouting job |\n| `/autorouting/jobs/get_output` | Get the solved routes from a completed autorouting job |\n\n:::info\nHere's the [source code](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/blob/main/lib/components/primitive-components/Group/Group.ts#L232) in tscircuit core where the `job` API is used to autoroute a circuit. You can\nsee that each endpoint is called in order\n:::\n\n```\nPOST /autorouting/jobs/create\n{\n  \"input_simple_route_json\": {\n    // ...\n  },\n  \"autostart\": true\n}\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n{\n  \"autorouting_job\": {\n    \"autorouting_job_id\": \"1234567890\",\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nGET /autorouting/jobs/get?autorouting_job_id=1234567890\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n{\n  \"autorouting_job\": {\n    \"is_running\": false,\n    \"is_finished\": true,\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\nGET /autorouting/jobs/get_output?autorouting_job_id=1234567890\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n{\n  \"autorouting_job_output\": {\n    \"output_pcb_traces\": [\n      // ...\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Configuration\n\nAdditional configuration parameters can be passed to either the `/autorouting/jobs/create`\nendpoint or the `/autorouting/solve` endpoint to configure the autorouter.\n\n| Parameter | Example Value | Description |\n| --------- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| `display_name` | `\"Nine-key Macropad\"` | A display name for the autorouting job. Useful for debugging! |\n| `provider` | `\"freerouting\"` | The autorouting algorithm to use |\n| `subcircuit_id` | `\"subcircuit_source_group_1\"` | To support subcircuit autorouting, you must accept this parameter and only solve for the subset of routes within the subcircuit. |\n\n================\nFile: docs/web-apis/the-registry-api.md\n================\n---\ntitle: Registry API\nsidebar_position: 1\n---\n\nThe tscircuit Registry API is an extension of the NPM Registry API that allows for additional features, such as building Circuit JSON in the cloud, automatic bundling to ESM and CommonJS, and more versioning automations.\n\n## Using the tscircuit NPM Registry\n\nThe [regular public NPM registry API](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/main/docs/REGISTRY-API.md) is available via `npm.tscircuit.com`. You can install endpoints from this registry\nby adding the following line to your `.npmrc` (or in\nany project with a `package.json` file)\n\n```\n@tsci:registry=https://npm.tscircuit.com\n```\n\nThis line says \"any package starting with @tsci should\ngo to the tscircuit registry instead of the npm registry\"\n\nSo you can now do `bun add @tsci/seveibar.usb-c-flashlight` to install that\ncircuit to your npm project!\n\n## tscircuit Package Format\n\nEvery tscircuit package is in the format `@tsci/<author>.<package_name>` to\navoid conflicts with other npm packages.\n\n## Advanced Bundling Endpoints\n\ntscircuit runs an ESM and CJS bundling service, you can use these\nservices to get a bundled version of any circuit, this is great\nfor dynamic loading and execution, e.g. we use it in our [tscircuit/import](https://github.com/tscircuit/import) module!\n\n## Advanced Registry Endpoints\n\nYou can use your tscircuit CLI token to use the advanced API at `https://registry-api.tscircuit.com`.\n\nYou can get a tscircuit auth token with `tsci auth print-token`. After you get this token, you just need to add the `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header to each API request.\n\nThe following endpoints are available:\n\n| Endpoint                   | Purpose                                                      |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `/package_files/list`      | List all the files in a package                              |\n| `/package_files/create`    | Add a file to a package                                      |\n| `/package_files/download`  | Download a file from a package                               |\n| `/packages/search`         | Search for a package                                         |\n| `/packages/list`           | List your packages                                           |\n| `/package_releases/create` | Create a new release (version) of a package                  |\n| `/package_releases/update` | Update a package release, e.g. to lock it from modifications |\n| `/package_releases/get`    | Get a package release                                        |\n| `/package_releases/list`   | List package releases for a package                          |\n\nMore information about our Advanced Registry API is coming soon, including a full OpenAPI specification!\n\n## Advanced Autorouting Endpoints\n\nYou can also use the registry to perform autorouting jobs for a\n[Circuit JSON](https://github.com/tscircuit/circuit-json) file.\n\n| Endpoint                       | Purpose                              |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |\n| `/autorouting/jobs/create`     | Create a new autorouting job         |\n| `/autorouting/jobs/get`        | Get the status of an autorouting job |\n| `/autorouting/jobs/get_output` | Get the output of an autorouting job |\n\n================\nFile: README.md\n================\n# [docs.tscircuit.com](https://docs.tscircuit.com)\n\nThis website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.\n\nRun `bun i` and `bun run start` to start a local development server.\n\n\n\n================================================================\nEnd of Codebase\n================================================================\n";
